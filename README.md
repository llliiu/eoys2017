Voronoin is a project to explore the structure inside of Voronoi cells.
It presents various Voronoi cells by wireframes, meshes, different colors and sizes.

- Whatâ€™s Voronoi ?
Voronoi diagram is an algorithm to divide space into pieces based on distance to points in a specific     
subset of the plane. 

- Future Works ?
Adding audio part; 
Improving Library Allovoro; 
Exploring more interesting interactions among voro cells.
